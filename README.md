# Theory of Complex Systems Assignment 

This repository was made for the Theory of Complex Systems course (2025). 

This model investigates neuron activity and binary data using probabilistic models such as the Poisson process and the Ising model.

## To run the model: 

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/znasser60/tcs-assignment.git

```

### (Optional) Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install the package in editable mode
```bash
